## TeenyLinux 👋

Work in progress.

Its better if you look at [buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) if you look for a somewhat or fully automated linux to be build for various targets that have busybox and or other programs.
if you seek to learn more about linux, or want full control on how and what to compile in your custom Linux build, look here: [linux from scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)

still here, great. Your looking to get a small, very small and clunky linux to run and prefer to thinker on my code. 
for now,its here: <https://github.com/CodeAsm/teeny-linux> because I need to transfer it over to this org page in the future
